      <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p class="abouttext">The SAED ICT program started on the 2nd day of December 2021, with the facilitator Mr. Gambo Suleiman introducing the basic software and hardware components of the computer explaining each component in detail. The facilitator went ahead to encourage participants on the advantages of programming and designing the web. It was a slow session since it was the first day of the program and the participants were still getting used to it.
      Interestingly, the second day took another turn as the program took a different dimension. The topic of discussion was HTML which stands for hypertext markup language which is a scripting language for the computer. He also introduced some salient applications like Git and GitHub which enables programmers to integrate their designs by enabling them to store their codes and exchange codes without difficulty.
      The class proceeded with the facilitator teaching the participate how to create the HTML tags which we went ahead to practicalâ€™s. At the end of the class, the facilitator gave an assignment to the participants to try and create HTML tags for the next class.  
      The third day took off by the facilitator introducing CSS to the participants. It stands for cascading style sheet.it is basically used to style the designs created by the programmer. The participants went ahead to try and merge the HTML codes created with the CSS to give it a beautiful outlook. At the end of the class another task was given to enable participants practice what the learnt to perfection.
      On the fourth day of the training, the participants were asked to create a Facebook login page. We were guided by the facilitator through the process. The performance of the participants was fair and a task was given at the end of the class to help master the codes and how to input them.
      The participants were taught how to use CSS to style and beautify the Facebook login page created the previous day. This involves changing the color of the login page, aligning the text on the page, adding a directory on the login page.
      After the training, the participants embarked on a SAED Capstone Project to implement all that was learnt.
